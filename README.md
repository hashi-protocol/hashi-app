# Hashi app

We built the first and only bridge for all your Non Fungible Tokens between Tezos and Ethereum. 

- You can wrap any FA2 token to Ethereum
- Or any ERC-721 token to Tezos

### Security

We imagined the protocol in such a way that there is no multi chain transactions, which are often attack vectors for bridges. Plus, it allow to add other blockchains in the protocol quickly, to expand the ecosystem of NFT tezos again and again.

### Decentralization

The protocol, unlike most of the bridges out there, can be use in a full trustless manner. We just deploy the 4 contracts needed to achieve this (2 per chain), and everything can happen without us now. Of course we also build an app, for non-nerds that just want to expand the field of possibilities for their NFTs.
